# **App Name**: MDC Panel+

## Core Features:

- Modules: Future development will be done via modules, ensure that the skeleton of the app is setup in a way that supports module-development so that we can tackle issues one by one.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 100%, 45%) (corresponds to approximately #4285F4), mirroring the Material UI primary color for a familiar, professional look.
- Background color: Dark gray HSL(210, 14%, 7%) (approximately #262626), for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Dark Blue HSL(210, 100%, 23%) (approximately #003366). This color is similar to Material UI's secondary colors, yet is distinct for interaction cues.
- Font: 'Segoe UI' for a clean, modern, readable interface. Using it for both headers and body copy.
- Use Material Design icons to maintain consistency with the Material UI aesthetic.
- Employ a grid-based layout, similar to the Material UI documentation, to ensure a responsive design.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as fading in new content or highlighting interactive elements on hover. Ensure you utilize libraries such as Motion to simulate smoothness and other animations. To load data when it comes to making any sort of API calls, ensure you use shimmer loading.
